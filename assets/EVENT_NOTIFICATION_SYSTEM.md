# Event Notification System

## Overview

The Event Notification System automatically monitors upcoming events and sends email alerts to registered users about potential food wastage. This system helps prevent food waste by alerting the community about events that might generate excess food.

## Features

### üö® Automated Risk Assessment
- **Risk Scoring**: Events are scored from 0-7 based on multiple factors:
  - Event size (number of expected attendees)
  - Time proximity (how soon the event is)
  - Event type (weddings, parties, conferences have higher risk)
- **Smart Filtering**: Only events with significant risk (score ‚â• 2) trigger notifications

### üìß Email Notifications
- **Comprehensive Alerts**: Detailed email with event information and risk assessment
- **Action Items**: Clear instructions on how to prevent food waste
- **Environmental Impact**: Shows potential environmental benefits of preventing waste

### ‚è∞ Scheduled Monitoring
- **Daily Check**: Runs at 9:00 AM to check for events happening today
- **Weekly Check**: Runs every Monday at 10:00 AM to check for events this week
- **Manual Triggers**: Admin can manually trigger notifications for testing

### üéõÔ∏è Admin Management
- **Real-time Status**: View system status and job status
- **Manual Controls**: Start, stop, and restart scheduled jobs
- **Event Overview**: See all upcoming events with risk assessments
- **Notification History**: View results of recent notification triggers

## How It Works

### 1. Event Monitoring
The system continuously monitors the `collaborations` table for events that are:
- Type: "event"
- Status: "Accepted" by admin
- Date: Within the next 7 days

### 2. Risk Calculation
Events are scored based on:
- **Size Risk**: 1-3 points based on expected attendees
- **Time Risk**: 1-2 points based on proximity to event date
- **Type Risk**: 1-2 points based on event type keywords

### 3. Notification Process
When events with risk score ‚â• 2 are found:
1. Fetch all registered users
2. Generate personalized email content
3. Send notifications to all users
4. Log results and update metrics

- **Water Saved**: Estimated liters of water conserved

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Jobs not running**: Check system status and restart jobs
